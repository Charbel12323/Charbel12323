# 👋 Hey, I’m Charbel

I like building fast systems, breaking slow ones, and running until my legs ask me to stop.  
I’m a **Software Engineer** who loves automating anything that gets too repetitive, too manual, or too boring for human hands.

By day, I work with **cloud automation, CI/CD, ML inference pipelines, and real-time telemetry systems**.  
By night, I tinker with side-projects, push random commits at 2:00am, and learn new things just because they're cool.

I’m also a **two-time hackathon podium finisher**, endurance runner, and someone who believes engineers should build things that actually *work in production*.

Currently, I’m a **Software Engineering Intern at Pason**, where I:
- deploy & automate large Linux workstation fleets  
- design secure data pipelines  
- write tools that prevent rigs from setting themselves on fire (metaphorically… mostly)  
- learn practical security & agentic AI safety so my GPT data doesn’t end up in the wrong hands  

If you build cloud systems, ML tools, digital twins, or anything that breaks and needs fixing, let’s connect :)
